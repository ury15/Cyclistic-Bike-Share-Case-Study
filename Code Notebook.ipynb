This can be done by converting the casual riders to annual members. To accomplish this, the marketing team needs to design focused marketing strategies. Hence, the task is to analyze the company’s user data to understand how the casual riders use the bike-sharing service differently than the annual members.\n\n### Data Information\n\nThe data used for the analysis is Cyclistic’s historical trip data for 12 months, ranging from November 2020 to October 2021.\n1. It is distributed under a [license](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement)\n2. The data is stored externally on the [cloud](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)\n3. There is no Personally Identifiable Information (PII).\n4. First-Party data, hence, original, and reliable.\n5. The data is downloaded and stored appropriately in a folder.\n\n\n### Data Processing\n\nThis is the stage to check the data to ensure integrity, completeness, correctness, relevance; and to perform data cleaning.\n\n### Tools:\n\n1.\tSpreadsheets – Perform initial data inspection and get an overview.\n2.\tRStudio – Develop script to clean, transform, organize, and summarize the data.\n3.\tTableau – Create Visualizations and Dashboard for final presentation.\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"## IMPORT LIBRARIES\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)  #tidyverse includes core packages like ggplot2 and readr which are helpful to wrangle data \nlibrary(lubridate)  #helps wrangle date attributes\nlibrary(data.table) #helps to write data into csv file\nlibrary(skimr)  #to provide summary statistics about variables in data frames, tibbles, data tables and vectors\nlibrary(dplyr)  #grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs\nlibrary(janitor)  #to examine and clean dirty data\nlibrary(modeest)  #provides estimators of the mode of univariate data or univariate distributions\nlibrary(ggplot2)  #helps visualize data","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Step-1 : Collect Data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"## READ ALL THE DATA STORED IN CSV FILES\n\nd1 <- read.csv(\"202011-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nd2 <- read.csv(\"202012-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nd3 <- read.csv(\"202101-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nd4 <- read.csv(\"202102-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nd5 <- read.csv(\"202103-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nd6 <- read.csv(\"202104-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nd7 <- read.csv(\"202105-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nd8 <- read.csv(\"202106-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nd9 <- read.csv(\"202107-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nd10 <- read.csv(\"202108-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nd11 <- read.csv(\"202109-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nd12 <- read.csv(\"202110-divvy-tripdata.csv\")","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Step-2 : Data Wrangling","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"## CHECK COLUMN NAMES FOR CONSISTENCY\n\ncolnames(d1)\ncolnames(d2)\ncolnames(d3)\ncolnames(d4)\ncolnames(d5)\ncolnames(d6)\ncolnames(d7)\ncolnames(d8)\ncolnames(d9)\ncolnames(d10)\ncolnames(d11)\ncolnames(d12)\n","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Metrics\n\n*After comparing column names, we can infer that there  are 13 variables/columns available, below is the metadata:*\n\n**ride_id** : Unique id of each ride trip\n\n**rideable_type** : type of bicycle ridden, split between 3 categories -
